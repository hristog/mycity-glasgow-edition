# MyCity: Glasgow Edition (prototype)

Source code for the Android prototype of _MyCity: Glasgow Edition_ app, which I invented as part of my undergraduate internship at the Human-Computer Interaction lab at the University of Glasgow in 2012.
The app was eventually refined in Master's level research projects and released on the Android marketplace as well as the iOS one.
In april 2014, the refined app was awarded a Gold medal at the _Game Changer_ awards in the _Creative & Cultural_ category.
